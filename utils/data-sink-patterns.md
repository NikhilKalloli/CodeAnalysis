  The post method is commonly used for sending data to a server, which can be a data sink.
- .*\.put\(.*\) (Confidence: 0.6)
  The put method is sometimes used to update data on a server, making it a potential data sink.

### File Patterns:
- api\/*
  Files within the api directory are likely to contain functions that make network requests, which can be data sinks.
- services\/*
  Files within the services directory may contain functions that interact with external services, making them potential data sinks.
- controllers\/*
  Files within the controllers directory often handle incoming requests and may send data to external services, making them potential data sinks.
- utils\/*
  Files within the utils directory may contain helper functions that make network requests or interact with external services, making them potential data sinks.
- .*\.http
  Files with the .http extension may contain HTTP requests, which can be data sinks.

## apiEndpoints

### Function Patterns:
- create\w+ (Confidence: 0.8)
  Function names starting with 'create' often indicate data being written or sent
- send\w+ (Confidence: 0.7)
  Function names starting with 'send' often indicate data being sent over a network
- write\w+ (Confidence: 0.9)
  Function names starting with 'write' often indicate data being written to a file or database
- update\w+ (Confidence: 0.8)
  Function names starting with 'update' often indicate data being modified or sent
- delete\w+ (Confidence: 0.7)
  Function names starting with 'delete' often indicate data being removed

### File Patterns:
- **/api/**
  Files within the 'api' directory are likely to contain API endpoints and data sinks
- **/controllers/**
  Files within the 'controllers' directory are likely to contain data sinks and business logic
- **/services/**
  Files within the 'services' directory are likely to contain data sinks and business logic
- **/repositories/**
  Files within the 'repositories' directory are likely to contain data sinks and database interactions
- **/*.controller.ts
  Files with the '.controller.ts' extension are likely to contain API endpoints and data sinks
- **/*.service.ts
  Files with the '.service.ts' extension are likely to contain data sinks and business logic

## clientServer

### Function Patterns:
- write\(.*\) (Confidence: 0.9)
  Function calls with 'write' in the name often indicate data being written or sent
- send\(.*\) (Confidence: 0.8)
  Function calls with 'send' in the name often indicate data being sent over a network
- post\(.*\) (Confidence: 0.7)
  Function calls with 'post' in the name often indicate data being sent via HTTP POST
- put\(.*\) (Confidence: 0.7)
  Function calls with 'put' in the name often indicate data being sent via HTTP PUT
- patch\(.*\) (Confidence: 0.6)
  Function calls with 'patch' in the name often indicate data being sent via HTTP PATCH

### File Patterns:
- *.ts
  TypeScript files often contain server-side logic and may include data sinks
- *.js
  JavaScript files often contain client-side logic and may include data sinks
- api/*.ts
  Files in the 'api' directory often contain API endpoints and may include data sinks
- controllers/*.ts
  Files in the 'controllers' directory often contain server-side logic and may include data sinks
- services/*.ts
  Files in the 'services' directory often contain business logic and may include data sinks

## High Priority Patterns
- API endpoint handlers
  Reason: These are the entry points for data ingestion and processing, making them critical for data sink analysis
- Database query builders
  Reason: These construct queries that interact with the database, potentially revealing data sinks
- Redis caching mechanisms
  Reason: Caching can sometimes obscure data sinks, so it's essential to analyze caching logic

## Priority Files/Directories
- server-dir/**/controllers/*.ts
  Reason: These files contain API endpoint handlers and are likely to have data sink logic
- server-dir/**/services/*.ts
  Reason: Services often encapsulate business logic, including data processing and storage, making them high-priority for analysis
- server-dir/**/repositories/*.ts
  Reason: Repositories typically interact with the database, making them a key area for data sink analysis

## Special Cases to Handle
- TypeScript type guards and conditional types
  Handling: Be cautious when analyzing type guards and conditional types, as they can introduce complexity and potential false positives
- Third-party library integrations
  Handling: When analyzing integrations with third-party libraries, consider the library's documentation and potential data sink implications
- Environment-specific configurations
  Handling: Be aware of environment-specific configurations (e.g., .env files) that may affect data sink analysis

## Potential False Positives
- Logging statements
  Reason: Logging statements may resemble data sinks but are actually just logging mechanisms
- Debugging code
  Reason: Debugging code may contain data sink-like patterns but is intended for development purposes only
- TypeScript type assertions
  Reason: Type assertions can sometimes be misinterpreted as data sinks, but they are actually just type-related constructs
